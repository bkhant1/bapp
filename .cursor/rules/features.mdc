# What is this app?

We are building a social media around book sharing. Book sharing is the vector to build and extend community and meet people with the same interests. 

## Core features

- create an account
- invite friends
- add books (for now input full information but later the plan is to take a picture of your bookshelf and automate it)
- discuss about books (both private chat and public comments)
- exchange books
- search for books amongst your friends, amongst friends of friends, and geo-localized search.
